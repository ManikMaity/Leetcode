# Leetcode
## Learned things
- Learned Extraction of number from tuf (Take you forward). - Ex - Defficulty: Easy/Count Digit (gfg)
- Learned number reverse from tuf. Ex - Reverse Integer (leetcode)

### Notes
#### Basic maths - 26/08/2024
- In num extraction algorithem the time coplexity is O(log10(n)) because in loop we everytime devide it with 10.
- If devide with 2 everytime the TC -> O(log2(n)).
- To reverse a num we can use (reverseNumber * 10) + last Digit (here initial reverse number is 0);
